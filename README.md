🚀 **Just Launched: My Custom AI Assistant Built with Chainlit, OpenAI Agents SDK & Gemini 1.5!** 🤖✨

I'm excited to share a project I recently built:
A fully functional **streaming AI chatbot** using **Chainlit**, **OpenAI’s Agent SDK**, and **Gemini 1.5 Flash** — designed for document-based Q\&A and real-time assistant interaction!

---

### 🔍 **Key Features:**

✅ **Streamed Token-Based Responses** – Experience real-time typing from the assistant for a natural conversation flow.
✅ **Chat History Memory** – The assistant remembers your previous messages to maintain context.
✅ **OpenAI Agent SDK Tool Support** – Built-in support to call external tools like `getuser_info()` to fetch data (can be extended to query ChromaDB / vector stores).
✅ **Chainlit Interface** – Elegant, fast, and reactive frontend interface powered by the Chainlit framework.
✅ **PDF-ready Integration** – Just a step away from querying uploaded PDFs using vector embeddings.
✅ **Custom Gemini Integration** – Integrated with `gemini-1.5-flash` using OpenAI-compatible API wrappers.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack:**

* 🧠 **LLM:** Gemini 1.5 Flash
* 🧰 **Framework:** Chainlit
* 🧬 **Tooling:** OpenAI Agent SDK (tool calling architecture)
* 📚 **PDF Parsing:** PyMuPDF (`fitz`)
* 🧠 (optional) **Vector Store:** ChromaDB
* 🧪 **Streaming & Async Architecture**

### 👨‍💻 Why I Built This:

As someone diving deep into **Agentic AI development**, this app helps me explore:

* Contextual memory in LLMs
* LLM function/tool calling
* Document retrieval via embeddings
* Fast prototyping of real-world assistants
